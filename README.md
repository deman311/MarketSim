# Simulation of a Supply and Demand System Using AI - Final Year Project

## Introduction

Welcome to "Simulation of a Supply and Demand System to Define a Winning Company Using AI". This project combines Unity 3D, MLAgents, and advanced AI models to simulate market dynamics and AI-driven decision making.

## Project Overview

The simulation models a dynamic market with stores, products, and customer behaviors, exploring the effects of supply and demand.

## Key Components

* Stores and Products: Detailed simulation of market entities. (Suggestion: Include a screenshot of store models from the simulation)
* Customer Behaviors: Algorithms simulating realistic customer actions. (Suggestion: Video clip showing customer interactions in the simulation)
* AI Models: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) compared. (Suggestion: Graphs showing model performance)

## Technologies Used

* Unity 3D Game Engine: For simulation creation.
* MLAgents: Integrating machine learning in the simulation.
* Python and PyTorch: For data analysis and AI model development.
* RNN and LSTM: Employed in AI models for sequential data processing.
